Hey, I'm Daniel. I'm a software engineer, developer advocate, writer, [public speaker](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPKBysBQJ0SllsI0APRl1BisRvXS-2vK-), and maker.

I currently work as a developer advocate at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) focusing on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

I take joy in solving complex problems with elegant solutions by simplifying and distilling core concepts.

I've worked at early stage startups and in the open-source space building products iteratively.

I'm proficient in full stack development and DevOps in modern cloud environments with a track record of owning the full cycle from idea to production and owning operating services using many of the [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) principles.

I'm an effective communicator and thrive in cross-functional teams. I enjoy learning and teaching and see it as an integral part of team work.
I combine those skills with teamwork and a strong understanding of the organizational structure to work efficiently and pragmatically in alignment with business goals.

I take an active interest in technology, economics, psychology, arts, and how their conflation impacts society.

The methodological and interpersonal aspect of software engineering has always interested me. My work in cross-functional teams has been a constant learning process, in which I grew professionally and interpersonally.

I'm a proponent of the open-source software and have contributed to several projects in addition to maintaining several open-source projects.

When I'm not working in front of screen, I enjoy cooking, reading, furniture design, woodworking, nature üå≥‚õµÔ∏è‚õ∞, bicycle mechanics, and motorcylcing.
