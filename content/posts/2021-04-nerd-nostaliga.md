Every once in a while, I get nostalgic and think about the good old days. And often, while reflecting, my rational voice kicks in and reminds me that they weren't that good. Just think about the days before we had antibiotics, or how crazy people were to get on a transpacific flight loaded up with fuel and then smoke on it. 

So I had one of these moments of nostalgia. I was reminiscing about my memories of discovering the Internet in the early 90s. We just got this white U.S Robotics 56k modem brought to us from the U.S. It had a large dial on the left side for the volume. We only had one phone line, which the modem would block. 

I'd wake up really early before anyone was up and sneak into my parents' room, where the computer and modem were set up. I could never remember which direction to turn the volume dial to mute it and often I'd wake up my whole family with those horrendous dial-up modem sounds that now sound like a sweet blast to the past.

The Internet has changed a lot since. Both positively and negatively. From a fringe playful virtual space to becoming the most important information spehere we check in the morning.

Wne of the most remarkable milestones of the Internet was both subtle and extraordinary. We went through an **infrastructure inversion** — the Internet used the outdated phone infrastructure until the Internet's growth and demands could not be met by the phone infrastructure. Eventually, it became the Internet infrastructure that telecommunication was running on; alongside Facebook, Netflix, YouTube, and all the other giant global corporations. 

We also have Internet native money with Bitcoin, ubiquitous encryption, and amazing projects like Wikipedia, and the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive) – a digital archive with the mission to give universal access to all knowledge. It's easy to forget that it was almost impossible to communicate securely and privately online 30 years ago.

The Internet was revolutionary and it arguably still is. But it's changed, it's grown up from being fun and playful into something mature that has a dark side. We're now at the stage where we've grown accustomed – and even dependent – to the utility and convenience it provides. All the while, we're learning about the perverse effects it has on us as individuals and society. Entrenching political polarisation, becoming an instrument of mass control, and making us feel lonely while overloading us with more information than we can possibly handle.

<!-- Remember the 2016 Pokémon Go craze:

> "Pokémon Go is a virtual reality game for mobile phones. It uses GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual creatures, called Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items. It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year. The game had over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than $6 billion in revenue as of 2020." ~ Paraphrased from Wikipedia

Pokemon Go is a cautionary tale. A fun new technology that quickly becomes questionable. Pokemon Go had over a billion downloads – that's about every 8th person in the world who left their home on an adventure to capture virtual characters. If that's not some kind of collective mania – I'm not sure what is. But maybe it's all innocent, fun, and playful? -->

The ever accelerating pace of societal and technological change in the last decade has made the Internet a fertile ground for information warfare. It's no surprise, given that the Internet basically gives anyone a megaphone. One-to-many communication is as available to anyone as it's ever been with blogs, Twitter, Substack, [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), Telegram, YouTube, and many more. Not all of these platform are equally censorship resistent. But practically anyone with access to the Internet can spread their ideas. And we're left to make sense of the world when there's so much conflicting information being thrown at us. 

How can we trust our institutions when they lie to us, as was the case when many health experts, no doubt motivated by the sensible and urgent aim of preserving the remaining masks for health care workers, started telling people that they didn’t need masks or that they wouldn’t know how to wear them.

In the good old days, the web was much smaller. Google didn't exist, so you'd rely on index sites to find things. Everything was slow. When my primary school got a "fast" ISDN connection, I'd spend after-school hours at the computer lab exploring the alternate reality of the Internet. You could pretend to be a different person and chat with others, also pretending to be different people. It was a space where you could be both weird and safe from the chaos and challenges of the real world which I was learning about through the Internet.

Having previously worked in Adtech (advertising technology), I'm intimately familiar with the extent to which information is collected on users. You're being constantly watched almost everywhere on the Internet. Our behavioural patterns are analysed by algorithms that then show us exactly what we want to see - a projection of our fragile egos. This is probably not new to most of us. We even have new terms to describe our predicament: [**surveillance capitalism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) and **techno feudalism** to name a few. 


In summary, the Internet matured lost its innocence. Much like our development, we grow up, lose our youth, and discover the complexities of life. As much as I love the modern Internet, it's a mess that sometimes makes me miss the good old days.
