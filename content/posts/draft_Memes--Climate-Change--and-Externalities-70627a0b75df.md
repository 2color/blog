During my travels in recent years, I noticed how fast ideas spread across cultures. The most conspicuous ideas are usually somewhat familiar and capture me first. Consumer culture trends are an obvious example, especially in countries with high mobile proliferation. The internet revolution and rise of social media have made it possible for ideas to travel at the speed of light.

Scientists even draw similarities between biological and cultural evolution in a field of inquiry called Memetics, focused on how ideas travel. Loosely, it is the study of culture and information through the lens of Darwinian evolutionary biology.

In memetics, the most fundamental unit is a **meme**. A meme is a unit of knowledge or culture. It can be an idea, a belief, or a pattern of behaviour. The constant bombardment with memes –a landmark feature of modern living– has deep implications on how we live our lives and social norms.

But how can we use memes to assist in solving one of the most pressing problems of our time — climate change?

A meme is analogous to a gene, insofar as it tends to replicate itself in hosts, i.e. human minds. Replication is the process in which the meme travels from one mind to another.

Some common examples include the most interesting man in the world. A beer advertising campaign depicting a debonair gentleman who radiates allure. He’s proclaimed to be the most interesting man in the world. The campaign’s ads end with the catchy meme: “I don’t always drink beer. But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.”

His small talk has altered foreign policy. He’s the most interesting man in the world…

The internet meme community, with its jungle-like evolutionary nature, has taken the essence of the meme and given it a new life. [Meme generators](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/10760000/i-dont-always) made it easy to create versions of the “I don’t always **X**, but when I do, I **Y**”. Curiously, in its mutated form widespread across the web, it was often self-deprecating, e.g.

Abstractly speaking, memes are founded on the idea of universal Darwinism, which consists of three simple things: **variation, selection and heredity**. In the MIMITW (most interesting man in the world) meme, we naturally get variants of the meme as they spread online and new variants emerge. If you’ve never seen this meme, simply play along and replace the X and Y in the template and you’ll get a new variant. Selection is the natural process by which the most adaptive (“popular”) memes spread. Because not all ideas are created equal, some tend to spread faster and in more. Lastly, heredity is the idea that features of adaptive (“popular”) variants are retained and passed on to other memes.

The question of how much of our cultural evolution can be attributed to memetics is highly controversial. Its critics will claim that it is reductionist. Conversely, its proponents like the physicist David Deutsch and the Biologist Richard Dawkins will attribute it great consequence in the human story:

> “The whole of biological evolution was but a preface to the main story of evolution, the evolution of memes.” — David Deutsch

Nevertheless, it is a useful tool in analysing the growth of human knowledge. 

In 2015, a [distressing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) of a marine biologist pulling out a straw from a sea turtle went viral. At the time of writing it has 37 million views. This meme evolved and spread as Greenpeace launched an alarming campaign in 2018 calling for a reduction in plastic consumption due to its impact on wildlife.

Later in 2019, the European Parliament [approved a new law](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20190321IPR32111/parliament-seals-ban-on-throwaway-plastics-by-2021) banning single-use plastic items, notably including straws. The topic has come up more than once in some of my woke circles and I believe the decision marks positive progress.

It’s feasible that the campaign influenced political reform. That would speak for the effectiveness of memes in creating the collective awareness that drives political change which in turn changes consumer behaviour in an open market. A ban on single-use plastics simply decreases the plastic waste that the European union generates.

However, the underlying problem appears to be broader. In economics, an externality is a side effect of an economic activity that affects other parties without it being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved. A common example of a negative externality is the exhaust gas from combustion motor vehicles. The car emissions incur a health cost on the rest of society and nature who are not compensated for it by the drivers producing the emissions.

The problem with externalities relating to the environment is two-fold: we don’t have a model for the global ecology, which means it’s difficult to quantify the ecological cost of every economic activity. Secondly, vested interest groups spend vast resources into spreading disinformation –with the help of so-called [Merchants of Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchants_of_Doubt)– or simply cheat as in the case of the [Volkswagen emissions scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal).

In 2019, there are still many crackpots with very little expertise and veracity who argue that human activity has no role in global warming. A [Nasa article](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/) on the topic cites an intergovernmental panel consisting of 1300 independent scientists who concluded there’s more than a 95% probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet. They could be wrong and there’s never absolute certainty (This principle is often referred to as fallibilism–the idea that no claim can be conclusively justified).

Conventionally, negative externalities are countered with regulation and taxes. For example, diesel cars have higher taxes, due to their higher emissions. Such efforts to regulate and pass carbon tax laws are often deflected lobby groups representing the car manufacturing industry. In Germany for instance, the State of Lower Saxony owns an 11.8% stake in Volkswagen Group. This raises questions about the potential conflict of interest given the close ties between industry and politics.

Taxes, despite being often despised are one of the most effective ways to change consumer behaviour, for example, tobacco tax was the most effective way to reduce tobacco use. [Evidence](https://www.who.int/tobacco/economics/taxation/en/) from countries of all income levels shows that price increases on cigarettes are highly effective in reducing demand. Warning labels — which could be seen as scary memes– had their role too, but it wasn’t until the taxation was introduced that behaviour changes.

Furthermore, incumbents in electoral democracies often lack the incentive to focus on long term problems, especially ones that incur a short term cost. For instance, reducing unemployment can be at odds with tackling climate change, and so the politicians must face the difficult reality of taking away coal mining jobs or introducing a carbon tax which potentially affects lower-income groups who lack access to other job opportunities due to location and education.

International treaties are another mechanism to combat global warming. The Paris Agreement is supposed to be that. The challenge with such non-binding agreements is that there’s a cost to leading the way. For example, switching to a more expensive green energy source creates a competitive disadvantage. In the current competitive and unstable geopolitical atmosphere, politics and power precede collective well-being and so we might find our selves amid ecological collapse.

> We are facing an unprecedented global emergency. Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making.

The future awaiting seems so precarious. And yet, we seem to go on with our lives. The [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/) movement has made it clear: **we must act now.**

> We are unprepared for the danger our future holds. We face floods, wildfires, extreme weather, crop failure, mass displacement and the breakdown of society. The time for denial is over. It is time to act.

#### Optimism

Despite the complexity of the situation and all political challenges, there are beacons of hope. According to David Deutsch, **optimism is the proposition that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge and that knowledge is attainable by the methods of reason and science.**

> “Problems are inevitable, because our knowledge will always be infinitely far from complete. Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems unlikely to be solved. Problems are soluble, and each particular evil is a problem that can be solved. An optimistic civilization is open and not afraid to innovate, and is based on traditions of criticism. Its institutions keep improving, and the most important knowledge that they embody is knowledge of how to detect and eliminate errors.” ~ David Deutsch

Human creativity is paramount to the growth of knowledge. Projects like [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/) and [refreezing the arctic with-geoengineerin](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24332450-700-refreezing-the-arctic-how-to-bring-the-ice-back-with-geoengineering/)g are amongst the many that take a novel approach.

Whatever the solutions will be, we should care about this more as a hurdle to the collective future of the human enterprise. Whether on the memetic, scientific, political, or innovative front, we can all take part in this.
