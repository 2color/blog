This is a series about the design and construction of a murphy bed â€“ a bed that folds into the wall and looks like a wardrobe.
Previous posts:

- [Part 3 - Joinery](/experiment-in-small-spaces-step-3-joinery)

In this post I will cover the construction process of the Murphy bed and challenges encountered along the way.

## Change of plans

In the previous post, I explored different joinery techniques and the options for knock-down joints. I wanted to make it possible to easily dissassemble the bed. That turned out to be a difficult undertaking. Especially given the weight-bearing requirements from a heavy construction.
Moreover, I realised that for the bed to look nice, it has to integrate visually into the room and be fixed to the wall. I therefor ditched the idea of knock-down joints and opted for pocket hole joints.

## Cut list

Because I designed the bed in Sketchup, I could easily generate a cut list with the [Cutlist plugin for Sketchup](https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/content/cutlist). This is one of the many reasons for designing upfront in 3D.

## Construction

Besides space restrictions, building the mattress base and the enclosing frame went pretty smoothly.

## Hinges

Unfortunately, during construction I discovered a flaw in the design. The swivel hinge was thicker than the specification. I had to compensate for that by [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(woodworking) both the outer and mattress frame so that the two swivels would fit. I solved one problem and created another. Routing weakens the outer frame of the bed, due to the reduced thickness of the plywood (18mm to 12mm). I solved that by doubling the thickness and gluing another plank of 18mm plywood on the outside of the frame.

For further robustness, I used threaded inserts and M6 machine screws to distribute the load evenly and maintain structural integrity in transition states of the bed when most forces are applied on the system as a whole. Intuitively, I achieved that by dividing the system into two major components and a single pivot point with very limited possibility for deviation from the desired motion.
