This is a series about the design and construction of a murphy bed – a bed that folds into the wall and looks like a wardrobe.

In this post I will cover the construction process of the Murphy bed and challenges encountered along the way.

## Change of plans

In [part 2](/experiment-in-small-spaces-step-2-designing-a-murphy-bed), I explored different joinery techniques and the options for knock-down joints. I wanted to make it possible to easily dissassemble the bed. That turned out to be a difficult undertaking. Especially given the weight-bearing requirements from a heavy construction.
Moreover, I realised that for the bed to look nice, it has to integrate visually into the room and be fixed to the wall. I therefor ditched the idea of knock-down joints and opted for pocket hole joints.

## Cut list

Because I designed the bed in Sketchup, I could easily generate a cut list with the [Cutlist plugin for Sketchup](https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/content/cutlist). This is one of the many reasons for designing upfront in 3D.

## Construction

Besides space restrictions arising from construction in such a tight space, building the mattress base and the enclosing frame went pretty smoothly.

## Hinges

Unfortunately, during construction I discovered a flaw in the design. The swivel hinge was thicker than the specification. I had to compensate for that by [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(woodworking) both the enclosing and mattress frame so that the two swivels would fit. I solved one problem and created another. Routing weakens the outer frame of the bed, due to the reduced thickness of the plywood (18mm to 12mm). I solved that by doubling the thickness and gluing another plank of 18mm plywood on the outside of the frame.

For further robustness, I used threaded inserts and M6 machine screws to distribute the load evenly and maintain structural integrity in transition states of the bed when most forces are applied on the system as a whole. By dividing the system into two major components and a single pivot point I reduced possibility for deviation from the desired motion. This proved to worked really well.

## The finish

I decided to add a couple of details along the way. Small things that would improve the overall functionality of the bed. The first was a spotlight fixture at the top of the outer frame. Because it's right above the head when sleeping, I opted for a remote controlled dimmable light. I've had great experiences with the [Zigbee](https://zigbee.org/what-is-zigbee/) system and decided to get Ikea's TRÅDFRI bulb and a remote control (which comes with a magnet holder that can be fixed).

To utilise the space on the left of the bed, I cut shelves to size and fixed them to the bed and wall with wooden ledges.

Lastly, the multipurpose shelf and frame leg was closed and fixed. After a long time sanding I applied some wax and the wood came to life. A truly exciting moment.

Seeing a long project come to an end is both satisfying and emptying. In hindsight, the closer I got to the end, the more it seemed like it would never end. This was a reminder that problem are inevetible. Staying comitted to the process was equally important to me as was reaching the goal of a working and built design. Seeing as this was so time consuming, it really made me appreciate the work of artisans.

More broadly, the project got me thinking on the future of furniture and design at large. The 3D model of the bed had very little value until it was tested to be worthy. Now that the design has been proven (at least to be functional) others can reuse the model and the cost of replicating the model (digitally) is practically non existent. In the consumer world, the word "design" implies more expensive. But most things created by humans are designed with intentions. At its core, design is a form of knowledge. And knowledge can be easily replicated. For example, the iconic Eames Lounge Chair was produced by Herman Miller in the US. To reach wider markets, they licensed its production to Vitra and Hille in Europe.
